#subtitle: This is where I will tell my friends way too much about me

My name is Yuchi Huang. I work for ACT, where I lead the team of automated content generation and spearhead research and development on the use of machine 
learning and AI in various educational applications. My technical background is in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision and 
machine learning. My current areas of interest include automatic generation of multimodal educational resources, multimodal analytics for measurement 
of complex skills and competencies, and deep learning based knowledge tracing.


Prior to joining ACT, I was an NLP research scientist at Educational Testing Service. From 2010 to 2015, I worked for GE Global Research and NEC Labs as a computer vision scientist. I earned my PhD in 
computer science from Rutgers University.
